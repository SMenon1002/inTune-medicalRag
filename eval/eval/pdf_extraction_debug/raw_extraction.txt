Key points
1. Severe hypertension requires urgent consultation and management. Hypertension associated with
encephalopathy is a medical emergency
2. All hypertension in children requires monitoring and follow-up
3. Blood pressure should be measured annually in healthy children
4. Where possible, abnormal machine BP measurement should be confirmed, preferably with a manual BP,
ensuring appropriately sized cuff is used for accurate measurement
Background
• This guideline will focus on the paediatric population aged 1–17 years (not infants)
• Hypertension in childhood is a key predictor of risk for hypertension, cardiovascular disease and end organ
damage in adulthood
• Primary/essential hypertension accounts for the majority of hypertension in children >6 years old and is
generally associated with obesity or a family history of hypertension
• Secondary hypertension is more common in younger children (<6 years old) with renal disease being the most
prevalent cause. This population is at greater risk of hypertensive emergencies due to an underlying condition
Assessment
Risk factors
• Overweight/obesity
• Male sex
• Family history of hypertension
• Low birth weight/intrauterine growth restriction
• Prematurity
• Excess dietary salt intake

• Confirm hypertension (See measuring blood pressure section below)
• Vitals:tachycardia, four limb BP for upper and lower limb discrepancy
• Height and weight:obesity, growth retardation
• Signs of end organ damage
• Fundoscopy:hypertensive retinopathy
• Cardiovascular: apical heave, hepatomegaly, oedema
• Chronic renal failure: palpable kidneys
• Focal neurology eg facial nerve palsies
• Signs of underlying cause
• General appearance:Cushingoid, proptosis, goitre, webbed neck (Turner syndrome), elfin facies (William
syndrome)
• Skin:Cafe-au-lait spots, neurofibromas, acanthosis nigricans, hirsutism, striae, acne, rash (vasculitis)
• Cardiovascular: murmurs +/- radiation, apical heave, reduced femoral pulses, oedema, hepatomegaly (CCF)

• Genitourinary:ambiguous/virilised genitalia eg CAH
Key points when measuring blood pressure(See video) (https://www.broadcastmed.com/cardiology/3979/videos/
blood-pressure-measurement-in-children)
Ensure the correct cuff size is selected for each patient, favouring a larger rather than smaller cuff (smaller cuff
creates artificial hypertension)
• BP cuff width should be 40% of the length of the arm measure from the shoulder tip to the elbow
• Abnormal oscillatory BP measurement needs checking with a manual BP from the child's arm
The table below identifies BP levels requiring further evaluation, starting with repeating the BP manually ensuring
accurate measurement

Assessment of severity
Interpreting blood pressure measurement
An online blood pressure centile calculator (https://www.mdcalc.com/aap-pediatric-hypertension-
guidelines#pearls-pitfalls)specific for gender, age and height can be used to determine the severity of
hypertension
Blood pressure classification in children and adolescents
For children aged 1 to 13 years For children aged 13-17 years
Normal blood <90th centile <120/<80 mmHg
pressure
Elevated blood ≥90th centile to <95th centile or 120/80 120/<80 to 129/<80 mmHg
pressure mmHg to <95th centile (whichever is lower)
Stage 1 ≥95th centile to <95th centile + 12 mmHg or 130/80 to 139/89 mmHg
Hypertension 130/80 to 139/89 mmHg (whichever is lower)
Stage 2 ≥95th centile + 12 mmHg, or ≥140/90 mmHg ≥140/90 mmHg
Hypertension (whichever is lower)
Severe Hypertension
Hypertensive >95th centile + 30 mmHg without symptoms/signs >180/120
Urgency of target end organ damage (See Examination) without symptoms/signs of target
end organ damage (See
Examination)

Clinical Practice Guidelines : Hypertension in children and adolescents https://www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/hypertension/
Hypertensive urgency
If medically stable, consider short acting oral agents while investigating cause
• Nifedipine
• Commence 0.25–0.5 mg/kg/day (max 20 mg) and titrate up as required to a maximum of 3 mg/kg/day (max
120 mg)
Hypertensive emergency
• Intravenous therapy; discuss with renal team and retrieval/ICU team
• Aim to gradually reduce BP to the patient's estimated 95th centile
• Decrease BP by 25% of the original value every 24 hours till target BP reached. Reduce rate of decrease if
patient becomes symptomatic

Investigations
First-line investigations
• UEC, CMP, urinalysis +/- renal ultrasound
• Consider LFT, Hb1Ac, fasting lipids particularly in children with BMI >95th centile
Further investigations should only be considered in consultation with a general or renal paediatrician
Consider further testing if child meets one of the following criteria:
• <6 years
• Concerns for secondary causes on history/examination
• Abnormal first-line investigations
Further Investigations
• Bloods: FBE, Bicarbonate, renin/aldosterone ratio, TFT, plasma metanephrins, cortisol, fasting glucose
• Urine: microscopy, protein/creatinine ratio, catecholamines, drug screen
• Imaging: renal doppler ultrasound, DMSA, CTA/MRA
• Other: echocardiogram, sleep study
Lifestyle counselling
Dietary modifications
• Rich in fresh fruit and vegetables/legumes, fish, poultry, lean red meat and low fat dairy
• Limit intake of high sodium, fat or sugar containing foods
Lifestyle modifications
• Increase physical activity, aiming 40 minutes moderate to vigorous exercise 3-5 days/week
• Consider counselling/behavioural techniques to help address weight management and metabolic risk
Medical management
Should be commenced if:

• Conservative measures have failed
• Symptomatic hypertension develops
• Stage 2 hypertension with no modifiable risk factors
• Hypertension in setting of chronic kidney disease/diabetes
Medical management should only be commenced in consultation with a general or renal paediatrician
• Long-acting calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine are recommended as first line therapy. Other
medication may be preferred in children with BMI >95th centile, diabetes or proteinuria
Consider consultation with local paediatric team when
• Red flags (see history section above) or ongoing concerns are present
• Hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency
• Medical management of hypertension is required
Consider transfer when
Child requiring care beyond the comfort level of the hospital
For emergency advice and paediatric or neonatal ICU transfers, see Retrieval Services (https://www.rch.org.au/
clinicalguide/guideline_index/Retrieval_services/)
Consider discharge when
Hypertensive children without severe features may be discharged with appropriate follow-up (See flowchart)
